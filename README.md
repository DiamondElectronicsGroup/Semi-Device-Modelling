# SemiDeviceModelling-
Calum's work on semi conductor device modelling in a python Jupyter notebook. 

Currently working with the Schimand and Hodges model for MOSFET/MESFET outputs.

Plots often fail to show at first, but clearing the outputs and the kernel then restarting appears to fix this issue.
